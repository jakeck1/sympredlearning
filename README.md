This repository contains the code associated to the preprint 'Symmetry and Generalization in Local Learning of Predictive Representations'   (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.27.595705 )

All experiments using a neural network with local learning rules may be executed through the notebook nn_experiments.ipynb

Experiments using a td-learning agent with a mofied learning rules may be executed through the notebook rl_experiments.ipynb
